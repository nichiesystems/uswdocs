Scurdex is a product of Nichie Systems, a Nigerian startup promoted by team of four and led by Samson Amosu(@samsonamosu). It is worth to mention that we leverage several open source project codes and we are most greatful for this. We will be making donation to these open source projects as soon as Scurdex become a profitable company.
