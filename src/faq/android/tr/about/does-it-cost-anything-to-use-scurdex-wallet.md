# Does it cost anything to use Scurdex Wallet? 

Scurdex Wallet is free to download and does not charge any fees for its base features.

The users are expected to pay network usage fees when sending transactions on a given blockchain. These fees tend to vary depending on the real time usage of the underlying blockchain network and do not relate to Scurdex in any way. 

The wallet app merely recommends a sufficient fee to ensure the transaction gets processed within expected time frame. More popular blockchains tend to be more congested and therefore have higher transaction fees. 

Scurdex is in the process to provide some premium power user features which are going to be only available to those holding Scurdex Tokens on the wallet balance.
