# Who is building Scurdex Wallet?

Scurdex is a fork of couple of open source projects including Unstoppable Wallet that started in in 2017 and is being built by Horizontal Systems.

- They are a 15-people engineering and creative team with an inherent passion for borderless fintech and DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations).

- They are no strangers to building complex software projects and the bulk of our engineering experience comes from designing and building high-load backend and mobile-first client systems.

- While the team has been involved in various SaaS ventures and fintech since 2013, they transitioned to the cryptocurrency and decentralized fintech domain professionally in 2017. This was primarily a result of experiencing highly limiting problems when dealing with traditional finance layers.

The idea to build a multi-chain wallet app presented an opportunity to learn the cryptocurrency tech stack and create a capital management instrument that lives outside the traditional finance layer.

Scurdex also use a couple of other popular open source verified codes in order to create a matching market advantage with other mainstream wallets and exchanges.
